# AUR. Roblox 

It's been a good 1 year.

most files require you to put a bot token and manually tweak where the bot sends messages etc. the designs can be changed too if you wanted.

# Deprecated files

- **⚠️ ugcsniper (ugc resale sniper)** - i've last used this back in January 2024 and im not sure if it works anymore, I'd advise using on an account with low robux and use at your own risk.
- **⚠️ scrappedcompletedsbot (trade completeds finder)** - this is similar to rotrack's function but uses a completely different method to find trades. However this version of it is very unfinished and requires proxies which can be very expensive. Was scrapped for obvious reasons

# Whats contained?

- **tradeadbot** - a semi-advanced rolimons trade bot designed to be used by many people at once. Was used in the AUR TRADE ADS server.
- **limiteddealfinder** - the code which found and pinged all deals in the main server
- **proofbot** - Code that mirrors proofs + trade ads in the rolimons discord server. Requires a token of an account in the rolimons discord to work
- **inventorygen** - advanced roblox inventory generator, has capability to be used anywhere
- **logo files** - everything to do with the AUR logo
- **icons** - Discord/bot/game icons made by me
- **othergraphics** - other graphics/images which i forgot the use was for

# if you need any guidance to setup any bot dm me on discord; upstep

love yall
